## <samp>This is what I do</samp>
 
I am a professional software engineer and the founder of SAAISolutions, a company dedicated to building large-scale, high-performance distributed systems. In addition to my expertise in technology, I am a well-rounded individual with a passion for the arts and adventure. I enjoy playing guitar, alpine climbing, cooking, and painting. As the famous quote by Leonardo da Vinci goes, "Art is never finished, only abandoned." I bring this same sense of drive and passion to my work, always striving for excellence and never settling for mediocrity.

My primary skill set includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, and frameworks such as Node.js, React.js, Express.js, and React Native. I use these technologies to develop robust, scalable web and mobile applications that deliver a seamless user experience.

To store and manage data, I utilize databases such as MongoDB and SQL, as well as Redis for caching. I utilize front-end design frameworks such as TailwindCSS and Bootstrap to create visually appealing and intuitive user interfaces.

To build and deploy my applications, I use Docker and Kubernetes to create microservices-based, event-driven architectures. I use npm as my package manager and AWS and DigitalOcean as my cloud service providers. I also have extensive experience with APIs, including REST, Open, and GraphQL, and use Jest for testing and webpack for building and optimizing my code.

My development process is highly collaborative and efficient, leveraging tools like git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. And with Next.js, I can create fast, efficient and SEO-friendly websites.

By leveraging these powerful technologies and my deep expertise in large-scale, distributed systems, combined with my passion for the arts and adventure, I am able to deliver innovative, high-quality solutions that meet the unique needs of my clients.
