## Let's get into personal stuff:

ðŸŸ¦ "It's better to live one year as a tiger, than twenty as a turtle", that's the quote with which I begin every single day. 

ðŸŸ¦ My experience and gained knowledge are highly skilled so far in: 
 - Creating Large Scale Web and Mobile solutions with Modern JavaScript Technologies
 - Implementing Modern and Advanced Data Visualization, Authentication and Design Patterns
 - Integrating required Technologies, APIs and Architectures
 - Testing Applications, making them Scalable and Secure
 - Working with Amazon Web Services
 - Designing Systems

ðŸŸ¦ But also at the end of the week I do some alpine climbing or hiking, because you should always remember that healthy mind can only live in healthy body ðŸ˜‰.
